# Todo in the Kemet Project.

## To Fix

- Fix the hover colors on (icons) svg in OpenClosedLabel Component in '\src\app\Components\ReuseableComponents\OpenClosedLabel.tsx'

- Complete Ordering page
- Customer form layout is done. (only layout)
- In EditColor Component, make only one edit form be open. (now there's a bug that allow all edit forms opens at same time) (done)
- In the OpenClosedLabel Component, i use onMouseEnter and onMouseLeave to mimic the hover to change the style and icons but in mobile view the style is broken because there's no mouse in it, and once it clicked, the style for change icon is applied that should be applied in hover and not gone
