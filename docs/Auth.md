# Signing Up

Since the business requires the customer be anonymous and not to have it singing in at all (currently), so I won't develop a sign up form that appears to anonymous customer, I'll only create one for admin and he can create it to his employees.

- Forcing a token to expire isn't top priority right now so, i'll delete it.
